## About the Project

This is an Exploratory Data Analysis of the Loan Default Dataset. The dataset is obtained from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/ankitkalauni/bank-loan-defaulter-prediction-hackathon/version/1?select=train.csv) and is part of the Machine-Hack Deloitte Hackathon. It contains various attributes of the loans customers have taken with the bank and whether they ended up defaulting on the loan. I will be performing Exploratory Data Analysis on the dataset to evaluate the relationships between the different attributes and their effect on whether a customer defaults on the loan.
